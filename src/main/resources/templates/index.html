                        Spring Boot, Hibernate, H2 DB was used in conjunction with Thymeleaf and Bootstrap,

                <p>Hi, I am a graduate student looking for a full-time job. I would prefer a purely IT job or
                    one where I can develop and use my IT knowledge together with project management and
                    economics. Please, do not hesitate to contact me on <a
                            href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-gavl%C3%ADk-52b434153/">
                        LinkedIn
                    </a> where you can also find a bit more about my previous job experiences </p>
                <h5>Background</h5>
                <p>
                    During my undergraduate studies, I profiled myself to become a Project Manager, ideally in software
                    development. I knew that it would be ideal to get technical knowledge, so I slowly started getting
                    into coding in java.
                    When I finished my undergraduate studies ( in Business Management) early in 2020, I finally decided
                    to fully commit to IT and CS.
                    I was able to prepare for the entrance exam and ultimately get to System Engineering and Informatics
                    and took a semester to catch up.
                </p>
                <h5>Goal</h5>
                <p>
                    Initially, I expected to just get an overview of the field so I don't feel out of place, but since
                    coding brought interesting challenges, I would love to continue my career as a developer rather than
                    PM.
                </p>
